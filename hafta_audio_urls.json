That\u2019s why tourists are unsafe here.\u201d Vivek adds, \u201cIn 2024, Bali got a little over 6 million foreign tourists. In 2023, they got over 5 million\u2026Forget Goa, Bali probably gets as many tourists as all of India does.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>On India\u2019s cleanliness problem, Jayashree says: \u201cCaste is the main driver of dirt. The wealthy produce the most waste and don\u2019t care about where it goes.\u201d Hridayesh says, \u201cWe dump solid waste into rivers; this happens with full knowledge of officials who take bribes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>On environmental degradation and the floods in Himachal Pradesh, Hridayesh warns, \u201cWe are doing everything to facilitate a disaster, not prevent one.\u201d He explains how unchecked construction and poor planning turns natural hazards into man-made disasters.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This and a lot more.

Neerja says it was important, since most young Indians today weren\u2019t alive during the Emergency and are unaware of its impact. But \u201chave we learned lessons\u201d, Abhinandan asks, and the panel has varying views.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Dhanya explains two new bills in Karnataka \u2013 one to tackle fake news, and the other criminalising hate speech. She talks about why both are problematic and what the Congress government in the state hopes to achieve.</p><p><br></p><p>The panel then discusses Sumedha\u2019s report from Nagpur, where she found over 29,200 new voters were curiously added to the electoral rolls in Devendra Fadnavis\u2019s constituency.
