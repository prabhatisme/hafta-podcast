That\u2019s why tourists are unsafe here.\u201d Vivek adds, \u201cIn 2024, Bali got a little over 6 million foreign tourists. In 2023, they got over 5 million\u2026Forget Goa, Bali probably gets as many tourists as all of India does.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>On India\u2019s cleanliness problem, Jayashree says: \u201cCaste is the main driver of dirt. The wealthy produce the most waste and don\u2019t care about where it goes.\u201d Hridayesh says, \u201cWe dump solid waste into rivers; this happens with full knowledge of officials who take bribes.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>On environmental degradation and the floods in Himachal Pradesh, Hridayesh warns, \u201cWe are doing everything to facilitate a disaster, not prevent one.\u201d He explains how unchecked construction and poor planning turns natural hazards into man-made disasters.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This and a lot more.

It\u2019s about the <em>performance</em> of authority \u2014 using science-y language to sound legitimate,\u201d Joyojeet says.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Shifting to Bihar\u2019s controversial Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, Radhika points out that in many places of Bihar, BLOs are signing for the missing voters.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>She remarks, \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is a random or routine process. It appears to be targeted, focused on constituencies where the ruling alliance anticipates a weaker performance.\u201d</p><p>Echoing her concerns, Raman added, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be an intensive verification exercise, but that\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s happening in practice.\u201d</p><p>Referring to the recent FIR against journalist Ajit Anjum, Abhinandan points to a troubling trend, \u201cThe nature of FIRs launched against journalists in the country is laughable. I don\u2019t know if the police expect the citizens to take them seriously.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Manisha calls out the BJP\u2019s repeated and unproven claims of Bangladeshi and Rohingya voters in Bihar constituencies and says, \u201cThey create this perpetual state of insecurity and panic before elections. This seems to be one of BJP\u2019s key electoral strategies.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Timecodes</strong></p><p>00:00:00 \u2013 Introductions and announcements</p><p>00:02:47 \u2013 Headlines&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:43-How influencers promote cow urine</p><p>00:47:39- Joyjeet\u2019s recommendations</p><p>00:49:021 - Bihar Special Intensive Revision</p><p>01:10:32- Letters</p><p>01:26:29- Recommendations</p><p><br></p><p><em>Check out </em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey, Ashish Anand and Anil Kumar.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Research assistance by Vibha Rajeev&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><br></p>",

          "summary": "<p>This week on Hafta, <em>Newslaundry</em>\u2019s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Raman Kirpal, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Faizan Mustafa, legal scholar and VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna, and Anuradha M Chenoy, former dean of JNU\u2019s School of International Affairs.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The episode opens with a discussion on the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025, recently introduced in Parliament by the government. Abhinandan asks Faizan whether the BJP will be able to get the bill passed in Parliament. Faizan responds that since it\u2019s a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which the current government doesn\u2019t have, the Bill is unlikely to be passed.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Raman questioned the intent behind the bill. He said, \u201cThe intent of the government is very clear that they have initiated several corruption cases against politicians whom they don\u2019t like and who fall out of favour, but yet they\u2019re not able to tame them.

          "summary": "<p>This week on Hafta, <em>Newslaundry</em>\u2019s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Akshay Bhambri, doctoral fellow at the Institute for Chinese Studies\u2013Harvard Yenching Institute, and Sumeet Mhaskar, professor at OP Jindal Global University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The conversation opens with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to China for the SCO Summit \u2013 his first visit to the country since 2018 \u2013 where he held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The panel analyses the optics of the meeting, body language narratives, and India\u2019s strategic balancing act.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Akshay argues that the Indian media\u2019s portrayal of Chinese reactions is not actually correct, noting that Chinese social media largely framed Modi\u2019s presence through Xi\u2019s success in convening world leaders rather than admiration for Modi himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<em>The Times of India</em> and <em>The Print</em> reported that Putin and Modi\u2019s car ride was trending on Baidu, China\u2019s equivalent of Google. It did appear in the top 20 of Baidu\u2019s trending list, but the conversation wasn\u2019t really about appreciating Modi or his actions. Instead, users were more focused on how Trump might react, what this meant for Putin, and how Xi Jinping had managed to orchestrate the moment,\u201d says Bhambri.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>He also questions PM Modi\u2019s visit with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cA big negative coming from SCO is that Modi met the right hand of Xi Jinping, Wang Yee, and all these people. When a head like the Prime Minister and president of China are meeting each other, there was no point meeting a second right hand of Xi Jinping, because that's a level below Xi Jinping.\u201d Bhambri adds.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Abhinandan adds, \u201cThe challenge for the Indian leadership is that Trump\u2019s unpredictability has forced everyone to realign their positions. He has shaken up the global order so dramatically that confusion is inevitable.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking on India\u2019s foreign policy, Manisha points out, \u201cIndian diplomats and India\u2019s foreign policy also have a lot to answer for, because they relied too much on the supposed personal chemistry of Modi with global leaders. Serious diplomats, or mandarins as they\u2019re called, should have calculated what could happen and what needed to be done as situations evolved. You have to work out your realignment in advance, because at the end of the day, this is a game of chess.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sumeet explains that social hierarchy plays a crucial role in how protests are treated. When dominant castes like the Marathas mobilise, the state response is far more restrained compared to how it would react if Muslims or Dalits staged similar demonstrations. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Timecodes</strong></p><p>00:00:00 \u2013 Introductions and announcements</p><p>00:03:30\u2013 Headlines&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:59 - <strong>&nbsp;</strong>PM Modi at SCO, Tianjin</p><p>00:59:55- Maratha quota protest</p><p>01:36:56 - Akshay &amp; Sumeet\u2019s recommendations</p><p>01:43:10 - Letters</p><p>01:50:28 - Recommendations</p><p><br></p><p><em>Check out </em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil .&nbsp;</em></strong></p>",

      "summary": "<p>This week on Hafta, <em>Newslaundry</em>\u2019s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Akshay Bhambri, doctoral fellow at the Institute for Chinese Studies\u2013Harvard Yenching Institute, and Sumeet Mhaskar, professor at OP Jindal Global University.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The conversation opens with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to China for the SCO Summit \u2013 his first visit to the country since 2018 \u2013 where he held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The panel analyses the optics of the meeting, body language narratives, and India\u2019s strategic balancing act.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Akshay argues that the Indian media\u2019s portrayal of Chinese reactions is not actually correct, noting that Chinese social media largely framed Modi\u2019s presence through Xi\u2019s success in convening world leaders rather than admiration for Modi himself.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201c<em>The Times of India</em> and <em>The Print</em> reported that Putin and Modi\u2019s car ride was trending on Baidu, China\u2019s equivalent of Google. It did appear in the top 20 of Baidu\u2019s trending list, but the conversation wasn\u2019t really about appreciating Modi or his actions. Instead, users were more focused on how Trump might react, what this meant for Putin, and how Xi Jinping had managed to orchestrate the moment,\u201d says Bhambri.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>He also questions PM Modi\u2019s visit with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cA big negative coming from SCO is that Modi met the right hand of Xi Jinping, Wang Yee, and all these people. When a head like the Prime Minister and president of China are meeting each other, there was no point meeting a second right hand of Xi Jinping, because that's a level below Xi Jinping.\u201d Bhambri adds.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Abhinandan adds, \u201cThe challenge for the Indian leadership is that Trump\u2019s unpredictability has forced everyone to realign their positions. He has shaken up the global order so dramatically that confusion is inevitable.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Speaking on India\u2019s foreign policy, Manisha points out, \u201cIndian diplomats and India\u2019s foreign policy also have a lot to answer for, because they relied too much on the supposed personal chemistry of Modi with global leaders. Serious diplomats, or mandarins as they\u2019re called, should have calculated what could happen and what needed to be done as situations evolved. You have to work out your realignment in advance, because at the end of the day, this is a game of chess.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>Sumeet explains that social hierarchy plays a crucial role in how protests are treated. When dominant castes like the Marathas mobilise, the state response is far more restrained compared to how it would react if Muslims or Dalits staged similar demonstrations. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Timecodes</strong></p><p>00:00:00 \u2013 Introductions and announcements</p><p>00:03:30\u2013 Headlines&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:59 - <strong>&nbsp;</strong>PM Modi at SCO, Tianjin</p><p>00:59:55- Maratha quota protest</p><p>01:36:56 - Akshay &amp; Sumeet\u2019s recommendations</p><p>01:43:10 - Letters</p><p>01:50:28 - Recommendations</p><p><br></p><p><em>Check out </em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil .&nbsp;</em></strong></p>",
