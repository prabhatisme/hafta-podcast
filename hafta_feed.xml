      <title>Hafta 577: AI Impact Summit, big tech brokering, and Delhi’s logistical chaos</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Amba Kak, a tech policy expert and researcher, and Alex Travelli, the South Asia business correspondent for The New York Times.The panel opens the discussion on the recently concluded AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, unpacking the logistical chaos, public participation, and the overarching implications of artificial intelligence on society and business and the talk of the town: Galgotias University.Amba Kak pulls back the curtain on the official agenda versus the reality. She says, “None of what is on the agenda really matters because the real agenda is being set in the announcements around the big tech investments and some brokering that happened with some extremely weak source commitments. So, it's almost like ‘have your fun, have your conversations, and we will be having the real summit elsewhere.’ And I think that is exactly what happened.”&amp;nbsp;Alex Travelli expresses skepticism over the massive capital influx driving the industry, noting that India is being treated as the world’s “largest living laboratory” for AI. “There's been too much money committed to this part of the world's growth cycle,” he warns. “There's just no way that these trillions can pay off in the way that a normal investment does.”The panel also notes the potential benefits of AI. Manisha, for example, makes an interesting point about using AI to address civic issues and improve state transparency, citing how cities like Memphis in the US are using AI to fix potholes.&amp;nbsp;Abhinandan, meanwhile, takes issue with the traffic chaos surrounding the AI Summit, noting: “In any other civilised democracy, citizens would not tolerate the kind of crap that happened... People are walking five kilometres to get a cab.” He’s not exaggerating – several attendees, including delegates, were forced to walk for kilometres to find a ride after vehicle access was barred for VVIP movement and the nearest metro station was closed.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 576 : Cinema, censorship and the crisis in Parliament </title>
      <description>his week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Anand Vardhan, Raman Kirpal and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by filmmaker Sudhir Mishra and senior journalist Arati R Jerath.The panel opens with a wide-ranging discussion on censorship, marketplace pressures, and cultural anxieties in contemporary cinema, covering topics from Bollywood’s ideological climate to the impact of OTT platforms.Speaking on film censorship, Sudhir says, “If I say as a filmmaker that I cannot make the films that I want to, then I’m scaring off a lot of young filmmakers. A lot of young filmmakers will think, ‘Yeah, then what about me?’ So it starts putting some sort of shutdown in their minds… unconsciously maybe.”He further adds that “The marketplace is a very big censor. At one point, they say you can’t make films with women in the lead. Comedies don’t work. But then something works and proves them wrong. Popular sentiment is there.”The conversation then shifts to the Opposition’s no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, examining the allegations of partisanship and the broader implications for parliamentary functioning.As Aarti points out, “Since 2014, politics has become extremely polarised… Vajpayee’s approach was consensual. He would meet opposition MPs and seek their help. Today, a lot depends on personalities in leadership positions… Both Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi see politics as a vehicle for personal agendas… There is a sense of settling scores.”Manisha adds, “I think there’s an understanding among parliamentarians that we are performing either for the benefit of a viral reel or for our media, which will cheerlead us on… There’s a confidence in the governing party that whatever we say will be played up really well on 24/7 primetime channels.”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 575: The Naravane book row, WaPo layoffs, and TM Krishna on ‘making democracy a culture’</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by musician and author T.M. Krishna and defence analyst Ajai Shukla for a conversation that spans Parliament flashpoints, billionaire ownership in journalism, and the deeper cultural fight over India’s national symbols.The panel opens with a discussion around the furore in Parliament over former Army chief General M.M. Naravane’s yet-to-be-released memoir this week. Questioning Om Birla’s claim that the Opposition was planning an attack on PM Narendra Modi, Manisha says, “It’s fear-mongering… the same story as what prime time had done back when the Prime Minister got stuck in a traffic jam.”Ajai Shukla opines that the very fact that a former Army Chief’s account is stuck in clearance limbo shows how tightly the government controls uncomfortable narratives around national security and China.The discussion then transitions to the layoff purge at The Washington Post, which Jayashree describes as a symptom of a world where media outlets are “bought by a billionaire” and then “gutted to maximise profits”.&amp;nbsp;Abhinandan argues that economics is not just a study of money, but a study of societies, adding that journalism is a public good that cannot be left to the mercy of a billionaire.Finally, TM Krishna discusses his new book, We, the People of India, which examines India’s anthem, flag, and other national symbols. Krishna contrasts Vande Mataram with Jana Gana Mana, arguing they reflect very different ideas of India. He also points to a deeper democratic failure.&amp;nbsp;“We entirely failed in making democracy a culture,” Krishna says, arguing that constitutional values were reduced to textbook lines you “just mugged up to write in an examination.”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 574: Economic Survey, Budget anxieties, and the UGC caste row</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam, and Anand Vardhan are joined by journalist Nikhil Inamdar and Sudipto Mondal, executive editor of The News Minute.The panel opens with a deep dive into the Economic Survey ahead of the Union Budget. Guest Nikhil Inamdar raises critical questions over the headline figures: “At a surface level, India’s 7.4% growth is world-beating. But the Survey also flags deeper structural concerns – capital flight, a weakening rupee, and private investment that has failed to keep pace.”On Budget expectations, Inamdar cautions against viewing the exercise as a panacea. “The budget is often treated as a moral document, but really it only sets the direction,” he says, noting that with limited fiscal headroom for stimulus or direct tax cuts, the focus will likely remain on expanding production-linked incentives and providing targeted support to exporters.&amp;nbsp;The conversation then shifts to the UGC’s new equity regulations, which the Supreme Court recently stayed. Sudipto Mondal offers a sharply critical reading, arguing the framework dilutes the specificity of caste discrimination. “This is one rare moment where the dragon is biting its own tail. The right wing is suddenly confused by its own creation,” Mondal remarks.He warns that the regulations flatten hierarchy by merging deeply unequal experiences into a generic category of ‘discrimination’. “They place extreme caste violence on par with far less violent forms of discrimination – and that invisibilises reality,” he says.This and a lot more.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;Hafta&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Newslaundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam, and Anand Vardhan are joined by journalist Nikhil Inamdar and Sudipto Mondal, executive editor of &lt;em&gt;The News Minute&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel opens with a deep dive into the Economic Survey ahead of the Union Budget. Guest Nikhil Inamdar raises critical questions over the headline figures: “At a surface level, India’s 7.4% growth is world-beating. But the Survey also flags deeper structural concerns – capital flight, a weakening rupee, and private investment that has failed to keep pace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Budget expectations, Inamdar cautions against viewing the exercise as a panacea. “The budget is often treated as a moral document, but really it only sets the direction,” he says, noting that with limited fiscal headroom for stimulus or direct tax cuts, the focus will likely remain on expanding production-linked incentives and providing targeted support to exporters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation then shifts to the UGC’s new equity regulations, which the Supreme Court recently stayed. Sudipto Mondal offers a sharply critical reading, arguing the framework dilutes the specificity of caste discrimination. “This is one rare moment where the dragon is biting its own tail. The right wing is suddenly confused by its own creation,” Mondal remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warns that the regulations flatten hierarchy by merging deeply unequal experiences into a generic category of ‘discrimination’. “They place extreme caste violence on par with far less violent forms of discrimination – and that invisibilises reality,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This and a lot more. Tune in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timecodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:00:00 - Introductions and announcements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:03:45&amp;nbsp; - Headlines&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:13:55 - Economic survey &amp;amp; Budget 2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:46:56 - Nikhil’s recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:49:31 - UGC’s regulations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:32:39 – Sudipto recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:36:25 - Letters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:50:21 -&amp;nbsp; Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Amit Pandey, with assistant production by Ashish, Sound by Anil Kumar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hafta 573: Funding the Davos circus while the net tightens on press freedom in Kashmir</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by journalist and entrepreneur Govindraj Ethiraj.&amp;nbsp;The discussion opens up with the recently concluded World Economic Forum held in Davos. Abhinandan sharply questions the performative nature of Indian participation at the forum, criticising chief ministers for announcing Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Indian companies on foreign soil. “We are funding the circus,” Jayashree remarks bluntly, calling Davos a “clown show” driven by optics rather than outcomes.Govindraj also agrees that announcing MoUs, especially with Indian firms, is a misallocation of time and attention, given how the WEF offers leaders “an opportunity to gauge the temperature of what is happening in the world order right now”.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The discussion also touches on the much-touted India-EU free trade agreement, which European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described as the “mother of all deals”. Govindraj, however, tempers expectations, warning that free trade agreements are often narrow and slow-moving. “The first bottle of cheaper Scotch won’t arrive tomorrow – it could take five years,” he quips.He further adds, “The red lines for India are clearly dairy and agricultural products… You can’t do something which immediately jeopardises your farming lobby. ​So, if you take away agriculture and cheese, what’s left now?”From Davos, the conversation shifts to press freedom in Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking on the recent summonses sent national&amp;nbsp; media reporters by the J&amp;amp;K Police, Manisha remarks, “Over the last one year, at least 25 journalists have been summoned by the J&amp;amp;K Police… anything at all can just land you in a police station being questioned, because it’s ‘public disorder’, you’re causing ‘public safety’ disorder.”Drawing a contrast between reporters in New Delhi and Kashmir, Abhinandan says, “It’s very difficult for someone in J&amp;amp;K to tough it out because there is no insulation. Delhi provides great insulation; that’s why those headquartered in Delhi have to step up and protect their reporters who are not in Delhi.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 572: BCCI vs Bangladesh, and the regime change debate in Iran</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam and Anand Vardhan are joined by Chander Shekhar Luthra, a veteran sports journalist, and Suhasini Haidar, diplomatic affairs editor of The Hindu.&amp;nbsp;The discussion opens with India’s latest cricketing row with Bangladesh, triggered by the release of Mustafizur Rahman from IPL 2026 following BCCI directives on apparent geopolitical grounds.Chander Shekhar sums up the fallout bluntly: “Bangladesh has always backed India at the ICC. There was never a single instance where Bangladesh voted against the BCCI. We’ve actually created an enemy for no reason.”Panelists also recall how cricket once acted as a diplomatic bridge – most notably during India-Pakistan engagements in the early 2000s. Jayashree notes, “I remember 20 or 30 years ago when cricket was actually used to soften political tensions. There was that India tour of Pakistan, a couple of years after the Kargil war, which was seen as a powerful gesture – a way of saying that the friendship sort of exists… That’s why this episode feels so petty to me. Are we officially at war with Bangladesh?”The discussion then moves to the nationwide protests in Iran. Suhasini stresses that the demonstrations are rooted in lived economic pain. “I don’t think the protests are completely run by foreigners. You’re seeing real protests on the streets.”She points to inflation, sanctions, and currency collapse as long-term pressure points, noting that the anger spans cities and social groups, not just activists.While acknowledging reports of severe repression, Suhasini cautions against overstating the immediacy of regime change. “The Iranian regime is going to have to keep dealing with the anger on the streets. But is that enough for regime change?”She also asks, “And will that regime change actually help?” noting that there is no historical evidence that external intervention in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, or Libya has ever successfully fostered democracy.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 571: Venezuela crisis, still no bail for Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam and Raman Kirpal are joined by Ishaan Tharoor, a foreign affairs columnist at The Washington Post and Advocate Vrinda Grover.&amp;nbsp;The discussion opens with an examination of the United States’ military operation in Venezuela and its global implications. Ishaan Tharoor says the Trump administration’s approach marked a clear shift in posture. “What we’re seeing are a set of impulses and a set of ideologies manifesting in very concrete ways.”This operation, he adds, reflects a departure from earlier US claims of restraint. “The administration has pinned its flag to the mast of not being the kind of administration that wouldn’t wade into major wars or nation-building projects abroad.”Manisha Pande discusses the implications of Trump's Venezuela operation for sovereignty in the Global South. “You are going back to that 19th century idea of imperial power among nation states, which says economic might precedes political sovereignty. Just because we are stronger economically, or we helped you build your systems and industries, we now have control over your political affairs. That's very alarming to me. And where does this stop?”The panel then turns to the Supreme Court’s recent decision to deny bail to Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam in the 2020 Delhi riots conspiracy case while granting bail to five other accused.Vrinda Grover remarks, “I think the Supreme Court needs to reflect very carefully on its own role. It does not help to apologise decades later for decisions like ADM Jabalpur, where fundamental rights were held to be suspended during the Emergency. Here, the court is saying that young people who organised protests — and who did not indulge in violence — must remain behind bars, as if they pose a grave danger.”She adds, “The tone and tenor of the judgment present this as an extremely dangerous situation. But that claim collapses when you look at who has been granted bail and who has not. So, what exactly is the Supreme Court saying?”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 570 : Dehradun lynching, Bangladesh in strife, and the gig worker strike</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam and Anand Vardhan are joined by Kallol Bhattacherjee, Senior Assistant Editor at The Hindu.The discussion opens with the Dehradun lynching, sparking a broader conversation on racism, social tensions, and the role of law enforcement in India. Abhinandan underscores that “leadership plays a crucial role”, noting how the rhetoric of public figures shapes societal behaviour.Manisha argues that the core danger is a culture of aimless, drunken male violence that can attach any available prejudice to its victim. “They would’ve done this to anyone there… it could’ve been a woman, it could’ve been a couple, it could’ve been a Muslim,” she notes, stressing that slurs get activated at the second stage of a fight, once “deep-rooted prejudice” is looking for a target.Kallol points out, “These attacks are facilitated by this overall sense of impunity,” suggesting that a lack of accountability exacerbates such incidents.&amp;nbsp;The discussion then turns to Bangladesh, which paints a picture of a country grappling with internal strife and external perception. Kallol provides an in-depth analysis of Bangladesh’s political framework, pointing out the underlying instability and its implications for foreign relations.&amp;nbsp;He emphasises, &quot;There is a very big factor of impunity,&quot; highlighting how a lack of support for the bureaucracy has destabilised governance, leading to a fragile state of law and order.India's response, as Kallol analyses, shows a shift in diplomatic language, emphasising a preference for relations with the people of Bangladesh rather than specific governments. This reflects India's cautious approach toward a neighbour amid political unpredictability.&amp;nbsp;The panel also touches upon the New Year’s Eve strike call by gig workers on Swiggy, Zomato and other quick‑commerce platforms.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 568: MGNREGA replaced, guarantees gone – and Messi comes to town</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Jayashree Arunachalam and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Development economist Reetika Khera &amp;amp; ESPN’s Anirudhh Menon.&amp;nbsp;The discussion opened with the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, which seeks to replace the UPA-era MGNREGA.Khera explained that MGNREGA was designed as a safety net rather than a poverty-alleviation programme. “It’s not supposed to help them live their lives,” she said. “It’s a subsistence guarantee — so you don’t starve, and you don’t have to migrate.”Khera highlighted that the new Bill weakens the certainty built into the original law. “The 125 days are not a guarantee,” she said, adding, “What is a guarantee is the notional budget — and how much that will be is completely up in the air.”She also pointed out that the Centre can decide where and when the Act will be notified. “There is no guarantee that it will be notified across the country,” she noted.Jayashree added that people who enrol under MGNREGA are often those with minimal choices in their lives. “This was that one small bit of choice they had,” she said. “Workers in general have little choice. Poorer workers have far less than that, and even that is being taken away.”She noted that while the scheme has shortcomings, it has played a meaningful role in improving lives. “MGNREGA is popular because a lot of people depend on it. It has flaws, but it has also made fundamental improvements,” she said.The discussion then shifted to the Messi G.O.A.T. tour. ESPN’s Anirudh Menon said the visit was structured around brand promotion rather than sport. “You’re not talking to Lionel Messi,” he said. “You’re talking to brand Messi.”&amp;nbsp;He explained that the tour involved ticketed appearances and private meet-and-greet sessions, with no football activity planned.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 567: Dileep acquittal, IndiGo meltdown and the cost of power</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Jayashree Arunachalam and Anand Vardhan are joined by Dhanya Rajendran, editor-in-chief of The News Minute and Anupam Manur, professor at the Takshashila Institution.&amp;nbsp;The conversation kicks off with a discussion on the acquittal of Malayalam film star Dileep in the Kerala actor assault case.&amp;nbsp;Abhinandan asks Dhanya whether Dileep was too powerful for the courts to act, or whether the investigation was so flawed that a conviction was never possible. Dhanya responds by explaining where the prosecution’s case fell apart. She highlights that in conspiracy cases, the entire chain – motive, communication, execution, and payment – must be established. With key witnesses turning hostile, that chain didn’t hold.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Commenting on the wider implications of the case, Jayashree notes that it has sparked conversations on workplace sexism, misogyny, and gender justice. She adds that Kerala, often perceived as progressive on gender issues, remains deeply patriarchal in reality, with gender being the area where it has made the least progress – “at times matching the worst examples of misogyny and violence seen elsewhere in India”.The conversation then shifts to the recent IndiGo crisis, which left thousands of passengers stranded after mass flight cancellations.&amp;nbsp;Anupam Manur notes that India’s aviation industry duopoly is the result of years of airline collapses, mergers, and policy decisions that gradually concentrated market power, raising serious concerns for consumers and regulators alike.He further adds, “For an airline that prides itself on efficiency and foresight, claiming it failed to anticipate new duty-time rules is hard to believe. Either this was poor planning – or a calculated gamble that passengers ultimately paid for.”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 566: Sanchar Saathi app fiasco, Putin’s visit to India </title>
      <description>This week, Newslaundry’s Manisha Pande, Shardool Katyayan and Raman Kirpal are joined by Medianama founder and editor Nikhil Pahwa and senior journalist Maya Mirchandani.The episode opens with the sudden rollout – and equally swift withdrawal – of the government’s Sanchar Saathi app.&amp;nbsp;Pahwa warned that forcing a government app onto personal devices crossed a critical line between governance and surveillance. “If you look at the permissions – access to messages, calls, galleries – it’s like the government sitting in your phone all the time,” Pahwa said.&amp;nbsp;Manisha noted that the app’s withdrawal within 24 hours raised questions about both intent and pushback. “The introduction and removal of it was very interesting. Why was it hastily introduced and then taken back?” she asked.Pahwa acknowledged the scale of India’s fraud problem but underlined that mandatory installation was never the solution. “The intention wasn’t wrong – but the question is the method,” he said&amp;nbsp;The conversation then moves to Putin's visit to India. Speaking on the media coverage of his visit, Manisha remarked, “Even if there is no deal or whatever happens, we've at least gifted him the great gift of our media, which is the sort of coverage that even his own state media cannot manage.”Maya Mirchandani noted that the visit gains significance as it comes amid renewed efforts to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war and rapidly shifting global power alignments.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 565: Behind the Karnataka Congress rift, Constitution disconnect</title>
      <description>This week, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Anand Vardhan are joined by content creator Meghnad S and Pooja Prasanna of The News Minute.The episode opens with an overview of Karnataka politics and the rift within the state unit of the Congress.&amp;nbsp;Pooja explains the growing impatience within D K Shivakumar’s camp, noting that he had expected a leadership transition after two-and-a-half years of the Congress government. “He’s now waiting for an assurance – any signal – from the high command,” she says, adding that the silence from Delhi has “triggered the first public signs of frustration” in the form of Shivakumar’s cryptic posts about “keeping one’s word”.The Chief Minister’s office, meanwhile, interprets Shivakumar’s messaging as an attempt to dilute Siddaramaiah’s governance record. “They believe he’s trying to take away from the CM’s narrative of fulfilling the five guarantees,” Pooja notes.Anand Vardhan draws attention to how this tussle exposes the Congress high command’s eroding authority. “The national leadership has limited patronage left. You can’t dictate terms the way you once could,” he says.The conversation then moves to the significance of the Constitution, considering the Samvidhan Diwas this week. Meghnad describes the code as “both prescriptive and reflective”. “It tells us what India should be, but also reflects what India actually is. And increasingly, those two are drifting apart.”Manisha adds that the Constitution has increasingly become a political tool rather than a lived document. “A lot of people bring up the Constitution today because it’s the best argument against the BJP,” she notes, explaining that for many, opposing the ruling party now automatically means invoking constitutional principles. She points out that during the 2024 election cycle, despite the heavy rhetoric around “samvidhan” and constitutional rights, it was mostly minorities who spoke about it with real urgency.This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 564: Killing of Madvi Hidma and aftermath of Red Fort blast </title>
      <description>This week, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Jayashree Arunachalam and Shardool Katyayan are joined by journalist and author Rahul Pandita and The News Minute’s Sudipto Mondal.The discussion begins with Rahul’s new novel, Our Friends in Good Houses, and then turns to the recent killing of Maoist commander Madvi Hidma in Andhra Pradesh.Rahul recalls meeting the man who recruited Hidma as a child. He then talks about the “tragedy” of the Maoists and the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist).&amp;nbsp;“One reason why we are witnessing this downfall now of the CPM office is that this somehow, in the passage of this time, steered away from what they had set out to do, which is to basically protect the adivasis and their natural resources. But during this course, I think they became obsessive about fighting the state…and became, in their own ways, stakeholders in these natural resources. That is the tragedy of the CPM.”Sudipto says, “The worst part about the Maoist movement is that it follows one basic principle of armed conflict, which is that the people sending people to war are old men. The people going to war are young boys.&quot;The conversation then moves to the Red Fort blasts. Abhinandan asks the panel about the video of a key suspect in the case justifying suicide attacks, seeking their views on whether airing such footage is irresponsible or journalistically necessary.This and a lot more.

      <description>In this special NL Hafta Live episode, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Anand Vardhan and Raman Kirpal were joined by The Hindu’s Sobhana K Nair and senior journalist Neerja Chowdhury to decode the Bihar poll results.On the sweeping mandate for the NDA, Anand spoke about Nitish Kumar’s enduring appeal, noting that he “maximises his EBC base better than anyone else. He knows how to balance administrative acumen with realpolitik.”Sobhana weighed in on Prashant Kishor’s poor performance, saying, “It is not a surprise to me that Jan Suraaj did not get even a single seat. There was a lot of disinterest in the rural regions of Bihar. A lot of distrust also. There were questions being asked about where he was getting so much money to put up such a big campaign.”Neerja highlighted the unusual nature of the mandate. “I have not seen this kind of a pro-incumbency wave in India despite 20 years in power. It is unprecedented.”On Nitish Kumar’s future in Bihar, she pointed to his biggest vulnerability: “The minus point of Nitish Kumar is that he doesn’t have a second line of leadership. Nor has he named a successor. At one point he considered Prashant Kishor but the story would have been different had they not fallen out.”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 562: Phase 1 of Bihar polls, Nitish’s legacy, Zohran Mamdani’s victory </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Anand Vardhan and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by The Hindu journalist Sobhana K Nair and screenwriter, producer and professor Sabrina Dhawan.The first phase of polling is done in Bihar, and Sobhana talks about Nitish’s relevance. She says after 20 years in power he “remains the single most popular leader” and that there’s “no leader who can hold a candle to Nitish Kumar in terms of personal integrity”. Anand adds: “His integrity is his shield – no major corruption scam against him, which makes him insulated from BJP's poaching tactic.”Sobhana explains how the Bihar government’s welfare schemes have empowered marginalised women in the state: “Women have the money. Women have the reservation. Women are now making decisions. So many places, I was surrounded by women, each one tugging at my sleeve to grab my attention, to tell me why this Rs 10,000 rupees is significant and how it has changed their lives.”On Zohran’s historic win in New York City, Sabrina says, “He built his campaign by listening to the people of that area...canvassing Trump voters, asking what their concerns were. Listening, building a platform based on constituents’ concerns, and delivering the message effectively through social media.”Jayashree frames the American Left’s sense of hope: “When you’re a leftist, there is so little hope to hold onto. Someone like Zohran, at least, is speaking a language tangentially connected to the things you want.”This and a lot more.

Someone like Zohran, at least, is speaking a language tangentially connected to the things you want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This and a lot more.

When asked about whether Prashant Kishor’s packed rallies translates to real political influence, he says, “PK clearly has a traction. His rallies are packed, and he has a 26 percent approval rating as a CM candidate, according to C-Voter. But there’s still a gap between people drawn to him and people ready to vote for him.”Manisha adds, “Even if people don’t want to vote for him, they’re interested in what he’s saying…he’s talking about education, young people, migrants not having to leave Bihar.”Ritu then joins the panel to talk about the Chhath Puja controversy in Delhi and pollution in the Yamuna. She says the river is in such a state “because the people are allowing it to be, society has to decide not to accept an unclean river”. Abhinandan isn’t as sure, saying: “I always blame politicians, not people. The man who cleans the street doesn’t have as much power as I do with a podcast.”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 560: Bihar assembly polls, Nitish Kumar’s chances, toxic air in North India</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam and Anand Vardhan are joined by journalist Arati Jerath and Sunil Dahiya, founder of Envirocatalysts.&amp;nbsp;The discussion begins in Bihar with Arati talking about Nitish Kumar’s relevance today. “The Nitish Kumar factor is the most critical in these elections. He has dominated Bihar’s political landscape for 20 years and built a loyal EBC vote base – 36 percent of the population,” Arati said.&amp;nbsp;On the Congress, she says Rahul Gandhi probably “realises that the Congress has to play second fiddle”, but he’s “caught between keeping his workers happy and accepting fewer seats”. The panel also discusses the relevance of Prashant Kishor, with opinions ranging from “grifter” to “gasbag” to Arati’s kinder parallel between Kishor and Kejriwal.&amp;nbsp;On Delhi’s air crisis, Sunil says years of awareness have passed but the situation is only getting worse: “Every indicator – private vehicle registration, petrol consumption, and nearby coal power generation – has increased.”He also questions the efficacy of the artificial rain project, pointing out its potential environmental and practical drawbacks. “Will you make it rain all winter across Delhi, NCR, Haryana, and Punjab? How resource-intensive and economically feasible is that?”Timecodes00:00:00 - Introductions and announcements00:03:27 - Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:08:33 - Bihar polls00:45:57 - Arati’s recommendation00:48:54 - Delhi’s air pollution01:20:35 - Sunil’s recommendation&amp;nbsp;01:21:28 - Letters01:34:14- RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil Kumar. </description>

      <title>Hafta 559: Taliban’s visit to India, Gaza peace plan agreement  </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Suhasini Haidar, Diplomatic Affairs Editor at The Hindu, and Dr Khinvraj Jangid, director and professor at the Centre for Israel Studies at OP Jindal Global University.&amp;nbsp;Abhinandan asks Suhasini whether it was “embarrassing” for the Indian government to have permitted the press conference barring women journalists with Taliban’s Foreign Minister. He also asks what pressure took place for a second presser to take place with women journalists.&amp;nbsp;“The Taliban doesn’t control the embassy in Delhi. The staff there still pledge allegiance to the previous, democratically elected government,” Suhasini says. “But when the foreign minister’s team invited journalists, only men were included. By the time everyone had gathered, it became clear that an all-male Taliban delegation was speaking to an all-male Indian journalist group. There were women journalists outside who weren’t allowed in, and it wasn’t just women who noticed – men also felt this was wrong, and some even sent apologies.”The discussion moves to the Gaza peace agreement. Khinvraj says, “If you look at Trump, in this particular instance, he reversed his earlier, reckless proposal that Gaza be ‘wiped out’ and the idea that the people of Gaza didn’t deserve to live there. He achieved this deal through compromise, making what I see as a powerful course correction.”&amp;nbsp;Jayashree is less optimistic. “Israel literally already occupies Gaza – it controls the movement of its citizens and what goes in and out. Yet it demands the surrender of arms as if a genocide hasn’t already been committed. We’re talking about hostages, but what about the thousands of Palestinians imprisoned and not called hostages simply because they’re not white?”Timecodes00:00:00 - Introductions and announcements00:03:07 - Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:09:05 - Afghan FM’s visit to India&amp;nbsp;00:45:57 - Suhasini Haidar’s recommendation00:49:07 - Gaza peace agreement&amp;nbsp;01:28:39 - Khinvraj’s recommendation&amp;nbsp;01:31:29 - Letters01:37:39 - RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Priyali Dhingra and sound recordist Anil Kumar.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 558: Madhya Pradesh’s cough syrup tragedy &amp; Trump’s Gaza peace plan </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Raman Kirpal, and Anand Vardhan are joined by senior journalist Nirupama Subramaniam and lawyer and author Prashant Reddy.&amp;nbsp;The discussion begins with Abhinandan asking Nirupama Subramaniam to decode the growing geopolitical churn in the region – from the complex India-China dynamic and Pakistan’s shifting stance after its recent bonhomie with the US, to Trump’s unpredictable sanctions targeting companies linked to Iran.She responds, “This whole idea of strategic autonomy that India has often cited over the last four or five years to justify its balancing act on various issues – from the Russia-Ukraine war to the Israeli offensive on Gaza – is being tested like never before.”Nirupama adds that despite India’s active participation in forums like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and its seemingly warm ties with the Biden administration, what has now come to light is that “there are clear limits to this so-called autonomy. At some point, strategic autonomy seems to have become merely a photo opportunity.”&amp;nbsp;The discussion then moves to the recent cough tragedy in Madhya Pradesh, which claimed the lives of at least 22 kids.&amp;nbsp;Speaking on this, Prashant explains, “It is the ninth such tragedy we've seen in India linked to contaminated medicine. These incidents trace back to the use of diethylene glycol in cough syrups, a chemical that is an industrial solvent. Pharma companies use it to dissolve medicines into syrup form, which makes administration to children easier.”&amp;nbsp;However, the problem arises because companies are supposed to use pharmaceutical-grade diethylene glycol, which is safe for consumption, and test it for contamination, he adds. “Diethylene glycol, when industrial-grade, is highly toxic, used in antifreeze and brake fluids, and is deadly for humans, especially children.”Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:05:25 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:13:46 - &amp;nbsp;Geopolitical churning &amp;amp; Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan&amp;nbsp;36:22:22 - MP’s cough syrup tragedy&amp;nbsp; -58:51:19 - Letters01:05:33- RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Sourav Ranjan and sound recordist Anil.&amp;nbsp;</description>

Pharma companies use it to dissolve medicines into syrup form, which makes administration to children easier.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the problem arises because companies are supposed to use pharmaceutical-grade diethylene glycol, which is safe for consumption, and test it for contamination, he adds. “Diethylene glycol, when industrial-grade, is highly toxic, used in antifreeze and brake fluids, and is deadly for humans, especially children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timecodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:05:25 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:13:46 - &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Geopolitical churning &amp;amp; Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;36:22:22 - MP’s cough syrup tragedy&amp;nbsp; -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;58:51:19 - Letters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:05:33- Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Sourav Ranjan and sound recordist Anil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hafta 556:  H-1B Visa fee hike, Ladakh protests, and Zubeen Garg’s passing</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri and Manisha Pande are joined by Pooja Prasanna, editor-in-chief of reporting at The News Minute; senior lawyer Mishi Choudhary; independent journalist Smita Sharma; and senior journalist Sanjoy Hazarika from the Northeast.The episode begins with Abhinandan asking Mishi to break down the H-1B process and how the new changes might affect it, and how they could impact the US economy.Mishi explains that about 85,000 H-1B visas are issued annually through a lottery. They’re valid for three years, renewable once for six years. After that, employers may sponsor a green card, creating a pathway from work visa to citizenship.Manisha adds, “So it’s not unusual for a populist leader like Trump to do something like this… It goes against the very creation of America. It is a country built by immigrants, and to suddenly paint them as people who are somehow antithetical to the idea of America is wrong.”Mishi further adds, “We know that some immigration policies were designed with certain considerations. For example, when H-1B was introduced, a small part of the fee was used to retrain American workers if they were going to be replaced by an H-1B worker. That element was already thought about.Pooja says, “We know how the H-1B system has been abused, particularly by Indians. I use the word ‘abuse’ carefully, just to give perspective.”The discussion moves to the unrest in Ladakh and the government’s action against climate activist Sonam Wangchuk.&amp;nbsp;Smita says, “Ladakh celebrated when Article 370 was abrogated in 2019. For the longest time, Ladakh had always felt sidelined when Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh were part of one state… They didn’t realise they would be reduced to a region without a legislature. Now, they are demanding the complete restoration of statehood. Another key demand is inclusion in the Sixth Schedule, which would grant them tribal status.”The podcast concludes with Sanjoy discussing Zubeen Garg’s death and his legacy.Check out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 555: Rahul vs ECI: The big voter deletion row</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Manisha Pande and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Dhanya Rajendran, editor-in-chief of The News Minute, and Nitin Sethi, founding editor of the Reporter’s Collective.&amp;nbsp;Manisha introduces the main debate on Rahul Gandhi’s voter deletion allegations. She asks Dhanya to explain the allegation and whether it was credible enough to merit a serious Election Commission probe, instead of being dismissed outright.Answering this, Dhanya says, “It's kind of complicated because what the allegation is that three different apps, the National Voter Service Portal or the NVSP, the Voter Helpline app, or the VHA, and the Garuda app of the Election Commission, were used to fill Form Seven. So Form Seven is basically somebody filling a form to delete a voter. So around 6,018 forms were filled.”She further explains, The Hindu had this story, I think two or three weeks ago. The Hindu story did track down some of these people whose names the forms were filled in, but they had no clue that the forms were filled… using their phones, that the OTP had come to them. Some of these phones were traced to Maharashtra, I think, Andhra Pradesh, et cetera. So the CID has written a letter as of last September this year saying that you have provided some details, but you have not provided all the details, including the destination IP and destination port. And without that, it's difficult to investigate as to how this was done.”Nitin Sethi criticizes the EC’s opacity: “The weakness lies with the Election Commission, the way it attempts to camouflage what it does, hide plenty and then lie sometimes… The Election Commission’s characteristic has been arrogance.”He stresses that the EC should be held to account as a constitutional body: “Let’s consider Mr Gandhi a citizen first, then a party leader.”Shardool chips in, highlighting how the broadcast media was portraying the issue. He says, &quot;The other strange thing was the media. They were asking on TV channels, 'Why do you have a problem? You won that seat.' Honestly, that’s a ridiculous question to ask. Who made you the editor?&quot;Speaking on the vote chori allegation, Manisha asks, “There is one aspect of the vote allegations – we call it, quote-unquote, a slogan by the Congress, but it’s not a fact. The first aspect is about calling out partisanship, bureaucratic slip-ups, and shady practices like unexplained additions and deletions. The second aspect is the broader claim that democracy in India is rigged, that elections are stolen, or that democracy is dead. Is it fair for the Congress, especially through Rahul Gandhi and press conferences, to link these two?&amp;nbsp;Moving to another topic, the panel discusses press freedom and ex parte injunctions, highlighting how challenging it is for smaller media organisations to handle such cases with limited resources.Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:03:20 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:09:44 - &amp;nbsp;Rahul’s fresh allegations against ECI&amp;nbsp;00:46:29 - Nitin’s recommendations&amp;nbsp;00:55:10- Freedom Of Expression of Media in current time&amp;nbsp;01:02:16 - Letters01:16:00 - RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 554: Nepal’s ‘GenZ’ protest: What, why and how </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Anand Vardhan, and Raman Kirpal are joined by Kanak Mani Dixit, founder-editor of Himal South Asian, and writer and podcaster Anurag Minus Verma.&amp;nbsp;The conversation opens with Abhinandan asking Kanak about the&amp;nbsp;current law and order situation in Nepal. “On the ninth of September, there was pretty much violence everywhere… the Army came onto the streets and there’s curfew, but things are calm now,” says Kanak.&amp;nbsp;He says the Gen Z representatives rooted their protest in two demands: good governance and action against entrenched high-level corruption.“Corruption that was not really being tackled by the system, even though the journalists were very capable over the last few years in digging up the muck. They were great muck records, but the state system, the courts, the investigation, the attorney general's office, nobody took it to a conclusion. All of that was base-level disenchantment in the whole country … The trigger was the suspension of about 25 social media platforms announced by the government,” Kanak states.&amp;nbsp;Manisha highlights that the unrest began with an attack on ‘nepo babies’. “What the young in Nepal are calling out is politicians’ kids who have access to vacations abroad, who have Christmas trees with Louis Vuitton boxes lined up. A lot of it starts off with this comparison of, look at these politicians’ kids – where they’ve gone, what they’re doing, what they’re capable of – and look at us. Where are we? The roads, the corruption, the houses falling. So there is this intense kind of barrage, especially on TikTok, of Gen Z going after Gen Z,” she says.&amp;nbsp;Abhinandan contextualises Nepal’s turmoil in relation to India’s size, and says, “It’s happening [here] –just too big. Kashmir and Kerala aren’t going to explode together. So don’t be under the impression it’s not happening. It is as violent, but our size keeps us together.”Yet, Kanak insists Nepal was not a failed state. “Nepal, even today, has a possibility of being an exemplar for South Asia… the only country in South Asia which doesn’t have a death penalty… where the Supreme Court passes its judgment in the national language,” he says.&amp;nbsp;Later in the show, Anurag argues that the very label “Gen Z” obscures more than it explains. “Gen Z can also be in the popular sense privileged kids into Netflix and chill… but Gen Z are also people living in small towns with very different aspirations.”Still, he admitted corruption remains a unifier: “In popular terms, corruption is one issue that can bring people across caste, geographical, linguistic lines… That is what happened during the Anna movement in India.”Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:03:50– Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:13:52 - &amp;nbsp;Nepal Protest from political view00:54:08- Kanak’s recommendations&amp;nbsp;00:58:04- Nepal’s protest from the lens of Gen Z&amp;nbsp;01:30:20 - Anurag’s recommendation&amp;nbsp;01:32:01 - Letters01:54:18 - RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 553: Modi’s bonhomie with Xi &amp; Putin at Tianjin, Maratha quota protests </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Akshay Bhambri, doctoral fellow at the Institute for Chinese Studies–Harvard Yenching Institute, and Sumeet Mhaskar, professor at OP Jindal Global University.&amp;nbsp;The conversation opens with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China for the SCO Summit – his first visit to the country since 2018 – where he held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The panel analyses the optics of the meeting, body language narratives, and India’s strategic balancing act.&amp;nbsp;Akshay argues that the Indian media’s portrayal of Chinese reactions is not actually correct, noting that Chinese social media largely framed Modi’s presence through Xi’s success in convening world leaders rather than admiration for Modi himself.“The Times of India and The Print reported that Putin and Modi’s car ride was trending on Baidu, China’s equivalent of Google. It did appear in the top 20 of Baidu’s trending list, but the conversation wasn’t really about appreciating Modi or his actions. Instead, users were more focused on how Trump might react, what this meant for Putin, and how Xi Jinping had managed to orchestrate the moment,” says Bhambri.&amp;nbsp;He also questions PM Modi’s visit with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.&amp;nbsp;“A big negative coming from SCO is that Modi met the right hand of Xi Jinping, Wang Yee, and all these people. When a head like the Prime Minister and president of China are meeting each other, there was no point meeting a second right hand of Xi Jinping, because that's a level below Xi Jinping.” Bhambri adds.&amp;nbsp;Abhinandan adds, “The challenge for the Indian leadership is that Trump’s unpredictability has forced everyone to realign their positions. He has shaken up the global order so dramatically that confusion is inevitable.”&amp;nbsp;Speaking on India’s foreign policy, Manisha points out, “Indian diplomats and India’s foreign policy also have a lot to answer for, because they relied too much on the supposed personal chemistry of Modi with global leaders. Serious diplomats, or mandarins as they’re called, should have calculated what could happen and what needed to be done as situations evolved. You have to work out your realignment in advance, because at the end of the day, this is a game of chess.”Sumeet explains that social hierarchy plays a crucial role in how protests are treated. When dominant castes like the Marathas mobilise, the state response is far more restrained compared to how it would react if Muslims or Dalits staged similar demonstrations.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Hafta, &lt;em&gt;Newslaundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Akshay Bhambri, doctoral fellow at the Institute for Chinese Studies–Harvard Yenching Institute, and Sumeet Mhaskar, professor at OP Jindal Global University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation opens with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China for the SCO Summit – his first visit to the country since 2018 – where he held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The panel analyses the optics of the meeting, body language narratives, and India’s strategic balancing act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akshay argues that the Indian media’s portrayal of Chinese reactions is not actually correct, noting that Chinese social media largely framed Modi’s presence through Xi’s success in convening world leaders rather than admiration for Modi himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Print&lt;/em&gt; reported that Putin and Modi’s car ride was trending on Baidu, China’s equivalent of Google.

      <title>Hafta 552: Online gaming ban, Trump’s 50 per cent tariff on India </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Raman Kirpal, Jayashree Arunachalam, and Anand Vardhan are joined by economist and author Vivek Kaul and sports journalist Sharda Ugra.&amp;nbsp;The episode opens with a discussion on the recently enacted Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, which seeks to promote e-sports, regulate digital platforms, and ban real-money games. Abhinandan asks Vivek if he views online gaming as gambling or not.&amp;nbsp;Vivek replies, “Even if you argue that it’s a game of skill – that you need to know the players, their performance, the pitch, the weather, and so on – the real question is whether people are actually treating it as a game of skill.”He further cites the government’s data, pointing out that 45 crore people are playing these games. With so many participants, he argued, it’s no longer a game of skill but has essentially turned into a game of chance.Discussing the Indian cricket team's jersey, Sharda notes that it is probably the most expensive real estate an advertiser can buy.&amp;nbsp; “But notice the kind of companies that were stepping in – new-age firms like FinTech or EdTech players trying to build credibility and public recognition. Big, established corporates weren’t lining up for it,” she says.&amp;nbsp;She adds that  it was everyone who was trying to give their brand and their company a certain respectability. “The cricket team jersey is the easiest way to do it.”&amp;nbsp;Adding to the discussion, Jayashree says, “For me, this [the Bill] is like wearing a helmet. You can argue that if people don’t want to wear one and risk dying, that’s their choice. But it’s really not; there’s a law that enforces helmet use for a reason. Similarly, you need a bit of legal paternalism here, at least to keep things in check.”The conversation then shifts to the recent US tariffs and their impact on the Indian economy. Responding to Abhinandan’s question on the media coverage of the issue, Vivek explains: “The media is right when it says  it's the Americans who will pay that tariff. But what they’re not telling the Indian audience is that our exports to the US, which are their imports, can easily be sourced from other countries instead.”Raman points out that campaigns promoting Swadeshi products have started in India to cope with the tariffs.Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:05:44 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:13:19:18 - &amp;nbsp;Ban on Online Gaming00:48:32- Sharda’s recommendation00:50:13 - US’ tariff’s impact on India&amp;nbsp;01:25:30 - Vivek’s recommendations01:27:33 - Letters01:35:42 - RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced by Amit Pandey with production assistant Ashish Anand and sound recordist Anil .&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 551: Constitution 130th Amendment Bill, thaw in India-China relationship, Alaska meeting</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Raman Kirpal, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Faizan Mustafa, legal scholar and VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna, and Anuradha M Chenoy, former dean of JNU’s School of International Affairs.&amp;nbsp;The episode opens with a discussion on the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025, recently introduced in Parliament by the government. Abhinandan asks Faizan whether the BJP will be able to get the bill passed in Parliament. Faizan responds that since it’s a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which the current government doesn’t have, the Bill is unlikely to be passed.&amp;nbsp;Raman questioned the intent behind the bill. He said, “The intent of the government is very clear that they have initiated several corruption cases against politicians whom they don’t like and who fall out of favour, but yet they’re not able to tame them. Since 2014, there have been 193 cases against politicians. Only two convictions have happened. So now the judiciary decides whether a corruption case is right or wrong,” he added.Manisha adds, “I think to me, it's very clear in the tradition of countries like China, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, where anti-corruption laws are used to crack down on rivals…And the BJP should worry about it because in these countries, which have no democracy, which have authoritarian leadership, once they're done with opposition, they use these laws to crack down on rivals within the party. So the BJP should also worry because this is not just about the opposition.”The conversation then shifts to the recent Alaska Summit, where Russian and US presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump met to discuss the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. Abhinandan asks Anuradha about the significance of the meeting: “Are you at all optimistic about this, or do you think it’s just optics and everything will stay the same?”Anuradha responds that the optimism comes from the fact that conversations and diplomacy are continuing. “In any war, especially in a situation where there has been a kind of cold war between Russia, Europe, and the US for years, this dialogue is significant. None of them had met over the last three years since Russia’s 2022 aggression on Ukraine, during which a proxy war had been underway.”The optimism, she explains, lies in the fact that they are now meeting and negotiating. “There will, of course, be disagreements, but as long as they don’t return to the old system of not engaging at all, there’s room for hope,” she adds.Shardool joins the discussion, pointing out that with China backing Russia, they don’t really have to worry about the United States.&amp;nbsp;“Also, the European Union cannot go against the US because its entire security structure is heavily dependent on American support – from troops to military machinery,” Shardool remarked.&amp;nbsp;Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:03:06 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:10:25 - 130 th Amendment Bill 202500:43:43- Faizan’s recommendations00:48:54 - India &amp;amp; China relation &amp;amp; Alaska summit01:17:11 - Anuradha’s recommendations01:18:32 - Letters01:33:34 - RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey , Ashish Anand and Naresh.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 550: Opposition’s protest against Bihar SIR, SC’s stray dogs order, and Uttrakashi floods </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by Priya Sahgal, editorial director at NewsX, Jasmine Damkewala, advocate on record in the Supreme Court, and senior journalist Hridayesh Joshi.The episode opens with a discussion on the opposition’s protest against the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar. Priya states that when the opposition sets aside its differences, it can make an impact. “The fact that everybody came together, even the AAP, even though they're not part of the India Block itself, also showed there is unity. When the opposition comes in full strength, they can make an impact and a difference,” she says.&amp;nbsp;Referring to Rahul Gandhi’s press conference on alleged voter fraud, Manisha notes how it is unusual for a political party to assume the role traditionally played by the media. “However journalistically sound it may be or not be, it’s still striking that political parties today also have to do the media’s job of starting a narrative through such investigations, because very few organisations have actually invested time in looking into this issue and the related complaints.”The conversation then shifts to the Supreme Court’s order to remove stray dogs from Delhi’s streets. Jasmine Damkewala notes that the dog population surged during the pandemic, when government-led sterilisation drives came to a halt. “Especially during COVID, no sterilisations were happening, or very little… The thing is, the state government is not really doing sterilisations. They do very little, and for that, too, they send the dogs to NGOs and pay them for it.”&amp;nbsp;Manisha adds that the court’s solution seems unworkable as there aren’t enough shelters to house the dogs. “This is Delhi – we haven’t even figured out shelters for humans during extreme heat waves or extreme cold waves,” she says.Abhinandan agrees and says, “For the Supreme Court to pass an order that is unimplementable is ridiculous. We have to acknowledge there’s a problem, but this is certainly not the solution.”For the discussion on the Uttarakhand disaster, Hridayesh joins from ground zero. He recounts his journey to the site of the tragedy, despite being denied permission by the local authorities. He also discussed the current situation at Dharali, the village most affected by the flood.&amp;nbsp;Check out the Newslaundry store and flaunt your love for independent media.&amp;nbsp;Download the Newslaundry app.&amp;nbsp;Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:05:46 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:16:47 - Opposition’s protest &amp;amp; INDIA bloc unity00:44:31- Priya’s recommendations00:47:53 - SC’s decision on stray dogs&amp;nbsp;01:11:04 - Updates on Uttarkashi disaster01:24:27- Letters01:33:40- RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey and Naresh.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week on Hafta, &lt;em&gt;Newslaundry&lt;/em&gt;’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by Priya Sahgal, editorial director at &lt;em&gt;NewsX&lt;/em&gt;, Jasmine Damkewala, advocate on record in the Supreme Court, and senior journalist Hridayesh Joshi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode opens with a discussion on the opposition’s protest against the special intensive revision (SIR) exercise in Bihar. Priya states that when the opposition sets aside its differences, it can make an impact. “The fact that everybody came together, even the AAP, even though they're not part of the India Block itself, also showed there is unity. When the opposition comes in full strength, they can make an impact and a difference,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to Rahul Gandhi’s press conference on alleged voter fraud, Manisha notes how it is unusual for a political party to assume the role traditionally played by the media. “However journalistically sound it may be or not be, it’s still striking that political parties today also have to do the media’s job of starting a narrative through such investigations, because very few organisations have actually invested time in looking into this issue and the related complaints.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation then shifts to the Supreme Court’s order to remove stray dogs from Delhi’s streets. Jasmine Damkewala notes that the dog population surged during the pandemic, when government-led sterilisation drives came to a halt. “Especially during COVID, no sterilisations were happening, or very little… The thing is, the state government is not really doing sterilisations. They do very little, and for that, too, they send the dogs to NGOs and pay them for it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manisha adds that the court’s solution seems unworkable as there aren’t enough shelters to house the dogs. “This is Delhi – we haven’t even figured out shelters for humans during extreme heat waves or extreme cold waves,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abhinandan agrees and says, “For the Supreme Court to pass an order that is unimplementable is ridiculous. We have to acknowledge there’s a problem, but this is certainly not the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the discussion on the Uttarakhand disaster, Hridayesh joins from ground zero. He recounts his journey to the site of the tragedy, despite being denied permission by the local authorities. He also discussed the current situation at Dharali, the village most affected by the flood.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newslaundry.com/store?routeName=NlStore&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; Newslaundry store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and flaunt your love for independent media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newslaundry.com/download-app&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; Newslaundry app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timecodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:05:46 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:16:47 - Opposition’s protest &amp;amp; INDIA bloc unity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:44:31- Priya’s recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:47:53 - SC’s decision on stray dogs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:11:04 - Updates on Uttarkashi disaster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:24:27- Letters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:33:40- Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey and Naresh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hafta 549: Trump’s 50 per cent tariff threat on India, Uttarkashi disaster </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of The Takshashila Institution, and senior journalist Hridayesh Joshi from Uttarkashi.&amp;nbsp;The episode opens with a discussion on Trump’s recent announcement to double the tariff on India, from 25 percent to 50 percent. Nitin argued that there is nothing wrong with India buying oil from Russia.&amp;nbsp;He said, “ I don’t think there’s anything wrong in India buying oil from Russia or from Iran or from wherever, as long as we can get away with it. To claim that, 'Oh, you're buying gas from a country which is at war and you're killing' is absurd… If the yardstick is that you're supplying or buying from people who are killing others, then the United States has to sanction itself to death.&quot;Manisha asks Nitin what India should do next.&amp;nbsp;Despite the current tensions, including the imposition of steep tariffs by Trump and the broader uncertainty in US-India relations, Nitin underlines a crucial strategic point: that the United States remains India’s most important partner for long-term growth and development.“Even after all of this, the United States is still India’s best partner for growth and development. We've got to work with these guys and figure out how we can make use of the US economy and US military power to help us grow and be secure.” Nitin said.He further added that it would be foolish to talk about retaliation or going to the other side and forming an anti-US bloc. The answer is not in Moscow or Beijing – the answer is still in New Delhi.For the discussion on the Uttarkashi disaster, Hridayesh joined the discussion from ground zero.&amp;nbsp;Hridayesh said that the death toll in the incident could increase as the rescue operation unfolds. He asserted that this disaster is not the result of the cloud bursts.&amp;nbsp;“According to the definition [of cloudbursts], you require a hundred millimeters of rainfall in one hour in a particular area. So it has not happened [in Uttarkashi]. And, the other theories that are coming in say that there may be some obstruction in the upper reaches, and it may have formed a temporary lake. And that lake burst because of some landslide from above or by its own volume or pressure because it was raining continuously.” Hridayesh added.&amp;nbsp;Manisha added that the Uttarakhand government’s focus should be on such national disasters, but their priority instead is ‘Land Jihad’, ‘Love Jihad’, and registration of live-in relationships.&amp;nbsp;Shardool added that you can negotiate with every human problem, but you cannot negotiate with nature. “Like an overflowing river, it does not care who you are and what you are, and what your problems are. Nature is very brutal in its judgment,” he said.

      <title>Hafta 548: Debate wars in Parliament, Trump’s tariffs on India </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande and Raman Kirpal are joined by Udit Misra from The Indian Express and independent journalist Sanjeev Srivastava.&amp;nbsp;The panel discusses the debates in Parliament on Operation Sindoor and the Pahalgam attack. Sanjeev says what stood out was Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s “insistence of accountability”, calling it the “strongest point in her speech”. Raman praises some of the Congress leaders for raising strong questions.&amp;nbsp;Manisha says news channels celebrated Modi’s speech in Parliament, using tickers like “showshopper operation” and “PM’s big speech”. “It was a nothing speech and it should be called out for that,” she says. She also deplores the fact that there’s still no detail on what happened in Pahalgam and says the public needs “correct information and clarity”.Udit then explains Trump’s new tariffs on India. “Trump is not necessarily a free market ideologue. In his head, it’s a zero-sum game,” he says. “He wants zero deficit. That can happen when you and I don’t trade at all.”Abhinandan sums up India’s failed outreach to Trump as “Modi’s whole diplomacy effort”, pointing out that “all the airtime wasted in telling us how close we are” finally came to this.&amp;nbsp;This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 547 :‘Paranoia’ in Modi govt, FTA myth, and an old police playbook</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Anand Vardhan, Raman Kirpal, and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by MK Venu, Founding Editor of The Wire, and award-winning investigative journalist and author Josy Joseph.The panel begins with a discussion on the recently signed “historic” India-UK free trade agreement. Venu argues that the BJP’s intention behind this FTA is to have a “fresh start” in global trade negotiations: “In the last 11 years of the Modi government, the narrative they built, led by Piyush Goyal, is that all the FTAs signed by the UPA government were bad for India, that they were being used as a conduit for Chinese goods.”The conversation then shifts to Jagdeep Dhankhar’s resignation as vice president. Abhinandan asks who will oversee the Rajya Sabha “with the parliament session already happening, and all sorts of noise and protests”.Explaining the legal framework, Anand says, “Article 67 says that till the next vice president is appointed, he will have to continue. But he has made it clear that he will not be attending the House.”&amp;nbsp;Venu draws a pattern of abrupt and unexplained resignations among the Indian political and bureaucratic elite: “There is a striking parallel in the manner in which Dhankhar, CBI chief (former Director) Alok Verma, and (former Election Commissioner) Arun Goel abruptly left. What is it that drives leadership in the Modi-Shah regime? There’s intrigue, there’s cloak and dagger, there’s paranoia. Paranoia accompanied by complete power. It’s a paradox.”Commenting on media speculation around Dhankhar’s resignation, Anand says, “Journalists and public and social media commentators cannot say the simple thing that ‘we don’t know’.” Jayashree adds, “It doesn’t matter if there is any value to these theories. What matters is that you have a story,&amp;nbsp;a source, the source has said something outlandish, and that is your headline.”The panel then shifts to the Bombay High Court’s recent verdict on the 2006 Mumbai blasts. Raman explains: “It’s a 576-page judgement talking about how the police have manufactured evidence in very great detail…This particular judgement has put a huge question mark on this state-specific law MCOCA.”Drawing from his decades of experience reporting on intelligence and security, Josy says: “One of the things that has always struck me was the impunity with which our police and investigative agencies are able to do pure malicious things and get away because there is no prosecution for malpractices.”Josy also sheds light on the complexities of police functioning and the political pressures that often influence investigations. “I think in India today, the most difficult job is not being a journalist or not being an NGO worker. I think the most difficult job is to be an honest government official.”Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:05:50 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:14:20-FTA Deal between UK &amp;amp; India / VP’s resignation00:47:55- MK Venu’s recommendations00:54:02 - Bombay Blast acquittal by the HC01:21:30 - Josy’s Recommendation01:27:33- Letters01:43:40- RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey, Ashish Anand and Anil Kumar.&amp;nbsp;Research assistance by Vibha Rajeev.&amp;nbsp;</description>

It’s a paradox.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on media speculation around Dhankhar’s resignation, Anand says, “Journalists and public and social media commentators cannot say the simple thing that ‘we don’t know’.” Jayashree adds, “It doesn’t matter if there is any value to these theories. What matters is that you have a story,&amp;nbsp;a source, the source has said something outlandish, and that is your headline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel then shifts to the Bombay High Court’s recent verdict on the 2006 Mumbai blasts. Raman explains: “It’s a 576-page judgement talking about how the police have manufactured evidence in very great detail…This particular judgement has put a huge question mark on this state-specific law MCOCA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from his decades of experience reporting on intelligence and security, Josy says: “One of the things that has always struck me was the impunity with which our police and investigative agencies are able to do pure malicious things and get away because there is no prosecution for malpractices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josy also sheds light on the complexities of police functioning and the political pressures that often influence investigations. “I think in India today, the most difficult job is not being a journalist or not being an NGO worker. I think the most difficult job is to be an honest government official.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timecodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:05:50 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:14:20-FTA Deal between UK &amp;amp; India / VP’s resignation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:47:55- MK Venu’s recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;00:54:02 - Bombay Blast acquittal by the HC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:21:30 - Josy’s Recommendation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:27:33- Letters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;01:43:40- Recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VCmV6yr5t1LHE77Xp5-cYhWrQSkhW3A8nix310MvRQU/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey, Ashish Anand and Anil Kumar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research assistance by Vibha Rajeev.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hafta 546: The performance of authority on social media, FIR against Ajit Anjum and Bihar SIR</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Manisha Pande, Raman Kirpal, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by University of Michigan’s Associate Professor Joyojeet Pal and senior journalist Radhika Ramaseshan.&amp;nbsp;The episode opens with a discussion on Joyojeet and his team’s research on the persuasion strategies used by social media influencers to talk about the benefits of cow urine.“One of the most interesting things we noticed was the use of scientific terminology by influencers who talk about cow urine. They say things like ‘it has phosphorus,’ or ‘it releases dopamine.’ These are not verified claims. But the point isn’t whether they’re true. It’s about the performance of authority — using science-y language to sound legitimate,” Joyojeet says.&amp;nbsp;Shifting to Bihar’s controversial Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise, Radhika points out that in many places of Bihar, BLOs are signing for the missing voters.&amp;nbsp;She remarks, “I don’t believe this is a random or routine process. It appears to be targeted, focused on constituencies where the ruling alliance anticipates a weaker performance.”Echoing her concerns, Raman added, “It’s supposed to be an intensive verification exercise, but that’s clearly not what’s happening in practice.”Referring to the recent FIR against journalist Ajit Anjum, Abhinandan points to a troubling trend, “The nature of FIRs launched against journalists in the country is laughable. I don’t know if the police expect the citizens to take them seriously.”Manisha calls out the BJP’s repeated and unproven claims of Bangladeshi and Rohingya voters in Bihar constituencies and says, “They create this perpetual state of insecurity and panic before elections. This seems to be one of BJP’s key electoral strategies.”&amp;nbsp;Timecodes00:00:00 – Introductions and announcements00:02:47 – Headlines&amp;nbsp;00:15:43-How influencers promote cow urine00:47:39- Joyjeet’s recommendations00:49:021 - Bihar Special Intensive Revision01:10:32- Letters01:26:29- RecommendationsCheck out previous Hafta recommendations, references, songs and letters.Produced and recorded by Amit Pandey, Ashish Anand and Anil Kumar.&amp;nbsp;Research assistance by Vibha Rajeev&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Hafta 545: Bihar electoral revision, Dalai Lama and the future of Tibetan movement </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Jayashree Arunachalam, Anand Vardhan, and Shardool Katyayan are joined by election analyst and researcher Amitabh Tiwari, along with historian and Newslaundry subscriber Swati Chawla.The episode opens with the latest updates on Bihar’s electoral politics and the ongoing Special Intensive Revision. Amitabh Tiwari calls out the contradiction at the heart of the process: “If Aadhaar is not the citizenship proof, then how can Aadhaar alone be used to get enrolled as a voter?Anand adds, “Supreme Court's presidents and the judgments have made it clear that voting is&amp;nbsp; a statutory right, and not a fundamental one.”Jayashree highlights the logistical absurdity in demanding documents: “In Bihar, only 40 percent of births are registered. So, most of the population won't have a birth certificate.”Shardool sums it up: “It is the Home Ministry's job to identify citizens, not ECI's. ”He questions the pressure on ground staff: “Booth level officers who are junior level teachers in government schools have left all their jobs and distributed 98 percent voter roll forms, and they are now saying that we are updating it 10 percent every day to over 60 lakhs forms.”The panel also reflects on prohibition in Bihar, with many youth supporting it as a way to reduce crime in public spaces. The conversation then shifts to the Dalai Lama, who turned 90 this week. Swati explains China’s obsession: “Control succession is a way to control society.”&amp;nbsp;She slams Beijing’s state-appointed Panchen Lama as illegitimate and applauds India’s unwavering support: “No country has done more for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan exile than India has.” Shardool says, “I believe India should be more aggressive to support.” Abhinandan presses: “If it’s worked so well, why is China still insecure about the Dalai Lama?”Anand adds historical context: “China has a state memory since the Han dynasty of forcibly settling people to secure territory, like Tibet.”&amp;nbsp;On what Tibetans want, he explains, “The Dalai Lama wants meaningful autonomy within China – not independence.”This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 544 : India’s lost tourism potential, and floods in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Manisha Pande, Jayashree Arunachalam and Raman Kirpal&amp;nbsp;are joined by writer and economist Vivek Kaul and environmental journalist Hridayesh Joshi.&amp;nbsp;The episode begins with a discussion comparing India’s tourism landscape with that of Southeast Asian countries and why, despite its size, beauty and culture, India remains far behind its Asian neighbours as a global tourist destination.&amp;nbsp;Manisha draws comparisons with cleaner, better-maintained cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Bali, and questions why India continues to fall behind in basic urban infrastructure and tourist appeal.&amp;nbsp;Jayashree says, “India is unsafe for everyone. That’s why tourists are unsafe here.” Vivek adds, “In 2024, Bali got a little over 6 million foreign tourists. In 2023, they got over 5 million…Forget Goa, Bali probably gets as many tourists as all of India does.”On India’s cleanliness problem, Jayashree says: “Caste is the main driver of dirt. The wealthy produce the most waste and don’t care about where it goes.” Hridayesh says, “We dump solid waste into rivers; this happens with full knowledge of officials who take bribes.”On environmental degradation and the floods in Himachal Pradesh, Hridayesh warns, “We are doing everything to facilitate a disaster, not prevent one.” He explains how unchecked construction and poor planning turns natural hazards into man-made disasters.&amp;nbsp;This and a lot more.

      <title>Hafta 543 : 50 years of Emergency, voter additions in Maharashtra, Karnataka’s new bills</title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Jayashree Arunachalam, Raman Kirpal and Anand Vardhan are joined by senior journalist Neerja Chowdhury, The News Minute’s editor-in-chief Dhanya Rajendran, and Newslaundry reporter Sumedha Mittal.&amp;nbsp;This week marked the 50th anniversary of the Emergency and the central government’s commemoration of the event. Neerja says it was important, since most young Indians today weren’t alive during the Emergency and are unaware of its impact. But “have we learned lessons”, Abhinandan asks, and the panel has varying views.&amp;nbsp;Dhanya explains two new bills in Karnataka – one to tackle fake news, and the other criminalising hate speech. She talks about why both are problematic and what the Congress government in the state hopes to achieve.The panel then discusses Sumedha’s report from Nagpur, where she found over 29,200 new voters were curiously added to the electoral rolls in Devendra Fadnavis’s constituency. This Newslaundry investigation has triggered a political outcry in the state, and Sumedha explains why.This and a lot more. Tune in!We have a page for subscribers to send letters to our shows.

      <title>Hafta 541: Air India crash, Manipur violence, covering crime stories </title>
      <description>This week on Hafta, Newslaundry’s Abhinandan Sekhri, Raman Kirpal, Manisha Pande, and Jayashree Arunachalam are joined by former Executive Director, Air India, Jitendra Bhargava, and Executive Editor of The Frontier Manipur, Paojel Choaba.&amp;nbsp; The episode begins with a discussion on the devastating Air India crash, where a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers, crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad. Jitender adds, “The cockpit voice recorder and black box will decode what actually transpired between pilot and the co-pilot…and what, if anything, was said to the passengers in the last moments.” Manisha raises concerns about Boeing’s history, citing, “Boeing has actually just wrapped up a long legal case in the US where they’ve paid a billion dollars for two crashes,” though Bhargava counters, “The safety track record must prove what it is,” given the Dreamliner’s extensive operational history.The panel critiques the media’s handling, with Jayashree expressing dismay: “I thought it was quite upsetting… families had found out minutes ago just as the reporters were arriving.”The conversation shifts to Manipur’s ethnic conflict, with Paojel providing firsthand insights. He describes a tense peace, “The shooting has stopped, but the violence has become more internal in a way.” Over 60,000 people are displaced, and “more than 200 people have been killed.”Commenting on the President's rule, he adds, “While there has been some recovery of arms under the Governor's rule, there has been no concrete positive actions to restore normalcy. But law and order has improved.” The panel also discusses the murder case in Meghalaya dominating headlines throughout the week and the ethics of covering crime stories.&amp;nbsp;This and a lot more.
